<h1>Java</h1>

After learning java for almost 4 months, I decided to try my skills by developing a small game using java awt and jpanel. Me and a small team developed a small shooting game where players run and dodge bullets and obstacles and try to make it into the getaway car. Laser shooting desert rangers and awfully fast chickens guest star.

<h1>Web Development</h1>

During the summer of covid, I began to try my hand at python. I became proficient in the language; building several complex projects. The first website I built was through a python framework called Django. This website simply offered a way for students to ask and answer I was able to deploy the code to heroku and use the postgresql database they provided

After that

<h1>iOS Development</h1>

Hello! I started the iOS Development class with no experience in developing in Swift, but I did have experience with developing in other languages such as javascript, python, and java. The first project I started was just a simple click game where players click on a button to earn money. The amount of money gained everytime after click the button can be increased by paying a cost to upgrade the amount of money made.

The next thing I worked was just a small step up: working on a simple dodge game. Players in this game must try to dodge falling spikes try to survive as long as possible.

The next project I worked on was a HUGE step up! Starting from a base spritekit project, me along with a small team built a full game where players must avoid becoming infected. Few players start infected and other players must stay alive and non-infected for as long as possible. 
<h4>Currently I am attempting to setup the connection between AWS DynamoDB and the backend of our iOS Application using a dependacy manager called cocoapods.</h4>
