<h1>Portfolio</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

Hey there! My name is Sarthak Agrawal you're currently reading my github portfolio. Below you will see some highlights of my projects. I was first exposed to programming as a freshman in highschool in the year 2018. My knowledge mainly extended to MIT APP Inventor and some java basics. As a sophomore, my java knowledge grew. At the end of my sophomore year, I was proficient in java and several libraries. Over the covid summer, I learned python and javascript and was able to build a few projects described here. In 2020, as a junior, I took iOS Development and developed several games and projects listed below as well.

<h2>Java</h2>

After learning java for almost 4 months, I decided to try my skills by developing a <a href = "https://github.com/EPHS-Java-2020/final-post-ap-project-2020-team-mario/"small game</a> using java awt and jpanel. Me and a small team developed a shooting game where players run and dodge bullets and obstacles and try to make it into the getaway car. Laser shooting desert rangers and awfully fast chickens guest star.

<h2>Web Development</h2>

During the summer of covid, I began to try my hand at python. I became proficient in the language; building several complex projects. The first website I built was through a python framework called Django. This website simply offered a way for students to ask and answer I was able to deploy the code to heroku and use the postgresql database they provided

After school started, I assembled a small team to work on a full website for students to ask questions and get answers. The website was to be split into two parts, for frontend and backend. The frontend is a react js single page application that makes API calls to a REST API backend built using the python framework Django. 
<h4>The website is currently in development, this will be updated!</h4>

<h2>iOS Development</h2>

I started the iOS Development class with no experience in developing in Swift, but I did have experience with developing in other languages such as javascript, python, and java. The first project I started was just a simple click game where players click on a button to earn money. The amount of money gained everytime after click the button can be increased by paying a cost to upgrade the amount of money made.

The next thing I worked was just a small step up: working on a simple dodge game. Players in this game must try to dodge falling spikes try to survive as long as possible.

The next project I worked on was a HUGE step up! Starting from a base spritekit project, me along with a small team built a full game where players must avoid becoming infected. Few players start infected and other players must stay alive and non-infected for as long as possible. 
<h4>Currently I am attempting to setup the connection between AWS DynamoDB and the backend of our iOS Application using a dependacy manager called cocoapods.</h4>
